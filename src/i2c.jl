"""
Returns a handle (>=0) for the device at the I2C bus address.

i2c_bus:= >=0.
i2c_address:= 0-0x7F.
i2c_flags:= 0, no flags are currently defined.

Normally you would only use the `i2c_*` functions if
you are or will be connecting to the Pi over a network.  If
you will always run on the local Pi use the standard SMBus
module instead.

Physically buses 0 and 1 are available on the Pi.  Higher
numbered buses will be available if a kernel supported bus
multiplexor is being used.

For the SMBus commands the low level transactions are shown
at the end of the function description.  The following
abbreviations are used.

```
S     (1 bit) : Start bit
P     (1 bit) : Stop bit
Rd/Wr (1 bit) : Read/Write bit. Rd equals 1, Wr equals 0.
A, NA (1 bit) : Accept and not accept bit.
Addr  (7 bits): I2C 7 bit address.
reg   (8 bits): Command byte, which often selects a register.
Data  (8 bits): A data byte.
Count (8 bits): A byte defining the length of a block operation.

[..]: Data sent by the device.
