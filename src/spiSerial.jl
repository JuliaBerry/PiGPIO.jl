"""
Returns a handle for the SPI device on channel.  Data will be
transferred at baud bits per second.  The flags may be used to
modify the default behaviour of 4-wire operation, mode 0,
active low chip select.

An auxiliary SPI device is available on all models but the
A and B and may be selected by setting the A bit in the
flags. The auxiliary device has 3 chip selects and a
selectable word size in bits.

spi_channel:= 0-1 (0-2 for the auxiliary SPI device).
 baud:= 32K-125M (values above 30M are unlikely to work).
spi_flags:= see below.

Normally you would only use the `spi_*` functions if
you are or will be connecting to the Pi over a network.  If
you will always run on the local Pi use the standard SPI
module instead.

spi_flags consists of the least significant 22 bits.

mm defines the SPI mode.

WARNING: modes 1 and 3 do not appear to work on
the auxiliary device.

2    1   0
3    1   1
. .

px is 0 if CEx is active low (default) and 1 for active high.

ux is 0 if the CEx GPIO is reserved for SPI (default)
and 1 otherwise.

A is 0 for the standard SPI device, 1 for the auxiliary SPI.

W is 0 if the device is not 3-wire, 1 if the device is 3-wire.
Standard SPI device only.

nnnn defines the number of bytes (0-15) to write before
switching the MOSI line to MISO to read data.  This field
is ignored if W is not set.  Standard SPI device only.

T is 1 if the least significant bit is transmitted on MOSI
first, the default (0) shifts the most significant bit out
first.  Auxiliary SPI device only.

R is 1 if the least significant bit is received on MISO
first, the default (0) receives the most significant bit
first.  Auxiliary SPI device only.

bbbbbb defines the word size in bits (0-32).  The default (0)
sets 8 bits per word.  Auxiliary SPI device only.

The `spi_read`, `spi_write`, and `spi_xfer` functions
transfer data packed into 1, 2, or 4 bytes according to
the word size in bits.

For bits 1-8 there will be one byte per character.
For bits 9-16 there will be two bytes per character.
For bits 17-32 there will be four bytes per character.

E.g. 32 12-bit words will be transferred in 64 bytes.

The other bits in flags should be set to zero.
